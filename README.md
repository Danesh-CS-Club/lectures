## Lectures

Since the purpose of Danesh Computer Club is to encourage modern working environments, it is necessary that we teach each other about fundamental programming concepts. Conferences will be held to discuss these fundamental concepts, therefore, here is a list of all the lectured concepts.

### 1: Introduction to Git and DevOps
**About:** In today’s rapidly developing software industry, smooth collaboration and fast delivery are a necessity. This presentation introduces Git as the basis of version control and DevOps as the philosophy and methodology that connects development and operations. Attendees will learn about fundamental workflows, branching models, and how DevOps methodologies (CI/CD, automation, infrastructure as code) enable fast and error-free collaboration on real-world projects.

### 2: Advanced Git
**About:** Collaboration is a basic requirement in work environments, hence it is essential for programmers to familiarize themselves with tooling that facilitates productivity while collaborating in stressful and boring environments. Git is currently the most widely used source control tool, but many programmers do not have sufficient knowledge to fully utilize it. In this lecture, we will discuss some less-known but essential git features and applications.

### 3: Mastery of Git
**About:** Based on the basics of Git, this advanced session will explore more expert-level concepts that professional developers use on a daily basis. Topics include interactive rebasing, expert-level merge strategies, Git hooks for automation, submodules for large projects, and efficient team workflows—enabling team members to work with complex repositories confidently and quickly.

### 4: Big(O) Notation
**About:** Big O notation is a concept that is critical to understanding the efficiency of algorithms, which is important for developing efficient code that can handle real-world loads. This lecture will cover the basics of Big O notation, from constant time O(1) to exponential time O(2^n), with examples, pitfalls, and advice on how to analyze and optimize code in an interview or project setting.

### 5: Introduction to RTOS
**About:** Modern embedded systems and time-critical applications require predictable and deterministic behavior, which general-purpose operating systems cannot provide. This introductory lecture will introduce the basics of Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS), including concepts such as tasks, scheduling, interrupts, and priorities, and explain why RTOS is so important in robotics, automotive, medical, and IoT applications.
