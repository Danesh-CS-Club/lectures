## Lectures

As Danesh Computer Club aims to stimulate modern working environments, it's essential that we educate each other on core programming principles and concepts. Conferences are intended to discuss these key topics, as such, here is a directory for all the lectured topics.

### 1: Introduction to Git and DevOps
**About:** In today's fast-moving world of software development, collaboration without friction and quick delivery are not an option. This session introduces Git as the foundation of version control and DevOps as the practice that bridges development and operations. DevOps practices are crucial because they help teams ship code faster, catch bugs early, and keep everything running smoothly even when many people work on the same project at the same time. Bad DevOps can stick even the best code in long review cycles or break it in production. Participants learn basic workflows, branching strategies, CI/CD, automation, and infrastructure as code to speed up teamwork and reduce errors in real projects.

### 2: Advanced Git
**About:** Collaboration is a fundamental skill required in workspaces, thus it is critical for programmers to grasp tooling that streamlines productivity while dealing in stressful and tedious collaboration. Git stands as the most popular source controlling tool, yet many programmers lack adequate skills to harness its full potential. We're going to talk about less known yet compulsory git functions and use-cases.

### 3: Big(O) Notation
**About:** Understanding the efficiency of algorithms is vital for developing efficient, scalable code that can handle real-world needs. Big O Notation is a standard method to express how an algorithm behaves with input size. This lecture covers essentials: Constant O(1), Linear O(n), Quadratic O(n^2), Logarithmic O(log n), Exponential O(2^n) — with practical examples, common pitfalls, and tips for interviews and projects.

### 4: Introduction to RTOS
**About:** With the growing requirement for predictability and determinism in latest embedded systems and time-critical applications, general-purpose operating systems cannot guarantee behavior. This introductory session focuses on Real-Time Operating System (RTOS), terminologies like tasks, scheduling, interrupts, and priorities. An important part is how RTOS treats concurrency and threading — different tasks execute “at the same time” (at least apparently) using threads, and the scheduler ensures important tasks get CPU time whenever they need it, no matter what else is going on. Unlike normal OSes, no delays are allowed.

### 5: Introduction to Website Optimization with Next.js
**About:** In today's fast-paced world, speed is everything. With Cloudflare handling around 20% of the entire web, understanding optimization methods is a necessity for any developer. Statistics prove over 50% of mobile users leave websites if it takes longer than 5 seconds to load! This session covers key optimizations like Cloudflare Workers for compression and caching, header configs for security and speed, lazy loading images, and DNS prefetch — all applied to our club site with Next.js. In contrast to slow loads, these cut LCP from 4.5s to 1.7s, making sites faster and keeping users around.
